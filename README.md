## Overview
This is a web API using Express.js. It runs a server with two endpoints: a home for testing, and a `/weather` endpoint that sends data from a JSON file to the user based on input to a form

## Getting Started
In order to run this server in development mode, use the `nodemon` package on `npm`:
1. `npm install -g nodemon`: this will allow you to hot reload code without restarting the server each time
2. `nodemon` (in your terminal): starts the server
3. Refer to front-end steps in [Frontend]('http://github.com/bhlieberman/city-explorer/README.md') to connect to the React app.

## Architecture
Please see diagram below for a visual explanation of this system's architecture
